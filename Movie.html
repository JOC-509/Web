<p>The video I created is my character talking to the narrator of the show telling him what is his mission. I took inspiration in some old shows where sometimes the narrator has some conversation with some characters. I used audacity for the voices and photoshop to do some animation at the end. The character got imported to the anime world and asking the narrator questions.</p>
